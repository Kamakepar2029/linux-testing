# linux-testing
This repo is for testing flashes, memory...

So run command 'install.py install' to install gen script
To generate a file with a start, but without end, you need to get to directory, where you want file to be after the installation of the script.
Then you need to run a command 'gen' and then enter how much MB you want to generate. And then press ENTER. Then in this directory will apear a file named 'testfile.try.txt', So that's all instructions.
